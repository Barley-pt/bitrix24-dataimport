## How it Works

1. **Webhook Setup:**  
   Enter your Bitrix24 REST webhook (needs CRM permissions).

2. **Fetch Fields:**  
   The tool fetches all available fields for Contacts and Deals, including user fields.

3. **Pipeline Selection:**  
   Choose the Bitrix24 Deal pipeline (category) for the import.

4. **File Selection:**  
   Choose your Excel or CSV file with your data.

5. **Field Mapping:**  
   Map your fileâ€™s columns to Bitrix24 Contact and Deal fields in easy, scrollable UIs.

6. **Deduplication Selection:**  
   Select the column to deduplicate contacts (e.g., Email, Phone, Name).  
   If left blank, will use the first "email"-like column or the first mapped field as fallback.

7. **Deal Contact Link:**  
   Select which Deal field will receive the Contact ID (usually `CONTACT_ID`).

8. **Import:**  
   For each row:  
   - Contact is created or updated (using deduplication)  
   - Deal is created, linked to the correct contact

9. **Done:**  
   You'll see a summary dialog when the import is finished.
